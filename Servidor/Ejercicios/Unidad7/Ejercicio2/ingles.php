Marc took advantage of his first occasion, in the Thai Grand Prix, where he beat Fabio Quartararo in the last corner to reap a new victory that allowed him to win his sixth MotoGP draw, being his fourth consecutive title and the eighth of his career, which places him to a title of Valentino Rossi and two of Giacomo d'Agostino in the historical classification of championships in the queen category.
